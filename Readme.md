# Angel Belt 
A Mod for Vintage Story

## What is it
The Angel Belt is a semi-expensive craftable belt that allows creative-like flight. 
Meant to help builders of large structures get to the work of building and decorating rather than building scaffolding.

## How to use it
Once crafted, place in your belt slot on your character.
- Press "R" to enable flight, you should hear a sound. Hitting R again disables flight regardless of how high up you are. 
- PageUP/PageDown +/- 1 Move speed
- F3 Cycles through Axis locks
- Home Resets all modifiers
- Alt+PageUp/PageDown +/- 0.1 Move Speed for finer adjustments

All keyboard shortcuts can be remapped in the game.
